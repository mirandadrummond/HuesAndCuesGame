# Hues and Cues Boardgame

The pygame version of Hues and Cues

Welcome to Hues and Cues!

Here we have the python version of the hues and cues boardgame which was prepared for a university class 'Algorithms and Data Structures' at IE University.

The purpose of the game is to receive hints (in this case 2 hints per guess) and try to guess the exact color. The further away your guess is the greater is your score. Player with the smallest score wins.

You can learn more about the game from the presentation here: [ADS Presentation.pdf](https://github.com/mirandadrummond/hues-and_cues/ADS.Presentation.pdf)
